## Projects

### [TP1 - Scene Graph](tp1)

-   Our implementation is compliant with the specification of the assignment, and so should be able to correctly parse and render XML files that are compliant with this specification. 
-   Our XML scene file is compliant with the specification of the assignment, without resorting to custom nodes or parameters that wouldn't be available to other parsers.
-   Our implementation is tolerant to errors in the XML scene file and unexpected nodes or parameters that aren't specified, logging a warning or error message but trying to still parse and render the rest of the scene.
-   We tried to make our implementation efficient, for example by avoiding reapplying an appearance when both the texture and the material of a component is "inherit".

-   Scene - Space Habitat Satellite
    -   This scene depicts a habitat space satellite orbiting the Earth. The moon and the sun are also visibile, as well as background stars.
    -   The XML file can be found in tp1/scenes/space.xml
